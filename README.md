# 🏥 Sports Injury Management System (Injury Assist)

## 🌟 Introduction
The **Injury Assist System** is designed to provide essential and fast support during critical unexpected injuries. By streamlining patient-doctor communication, it minimizes risks associated with delayed care and ensures injuries are properly assessed with topical treatments to prevent them from worsening.

## 📊 System Design (UML)
Below is the Object-Oriented design of the system.

## 🚀 Key Functionality
* **Determine Injury & Severity**: Logic-based assessment to categorize injury levels.
* **Treatment Matching**: Automatically suggests suitable treatments based on injury type.
* **Appointment Booking**: Integrated system for scheduling medical visits.
* **Patient Records**: Securely saves data and generates a summarized report for every patient.
* **Automated Reporting**: Patients receive medical reports to assist in their future health management.

## 🏗️ OOP Implementation (Java)
We utilized **Object-Oriented Programming** in Java to ensure the system is modular and scalable:
* **Encapsulation**: Private fields for patient data with secure accessors.
* **Swing GUI**: A user-friendly desktop interface for both athletes and doctors.
* **Data Management**: Clean separation between the UI and the data logic.

## 💡 Motivation
* **For Doctors**: To categorize injuries and simplify the diagnosis process.
* **For Patients**: To provide helpful, long-term health summaries.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
3. Run the main class to launch the Java Swing interface.
